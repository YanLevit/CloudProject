React Blog Application with Node.js, MySQL, Amazon RDS, and S3 Integration
Welcome to the README file for the React Blog Application with Node.js, MySQL, Amazon RDS, and S3 integration project. This document provides an overview of the project, its architecture, setup instructions, and other relevant information.

Project Overview
The React Blog Application is a web-based platform that allows users to read and create blog posts. It integrates various technologies to ensure a robust and scalable solution. Here's a high-level overview of the key components:

Frontend: The frontend of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides an intuitive and responsive user interface for reading and creating blog posts.

Backend: The backend is powered by Node.js, which handles various API requests, database interactions, and S3 integration. It provides the necessary endpoints for user authentication, fetching and creating blog posts, and managing images.

Database: The application uses MySQL as the database system. The MySQL database is hosted on Amazon RDS, providing scalability, high availability, and managed database services.

Image Storage: Images associated with blog posts are stored in an S3 bucket, which provides secure and scalable object storage. This integration ensures efficient handling of images while keeping the database lightweight.

Servers: The application is hosted on CentOS 7 EC2 instances. An Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) is set up to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances, ensuring high availability and improved performance. Additionally, a separate backup server is maintained to ensure redundancy and disaster recovery.

Architecture

User interacts with the React frontend through a web browser.
React frontend sends API requests to the Node.js backend.
Node.js backend handles requests and interacts with the MySQL database hosted on Amazon RDS.
Images associated with blog posts are stored in an S3 bucket.
Application servers (CentOS 7 EC2 instances) host the frontend and backend components.
Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) distributes incoming traffic across multiple application server instances.
A separate backup server ensures redundancy and disaster recovery.
Setup Instructions
To set up the React Blog Application on your own environment, follow these general steps:

Prerequisites:

Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
MySQL client and credentials to connect to your Amazon RDS instance.
An AWS account with permissions for S3 and EC2.
Basic familiarity with React, Node.js, MySQL, and AWS services.
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd to where the repo is cloned 
Install Dependencies:

bash
cd client
yarn

cd ../api
yarn

Configure Environment Variables:

Rename .env.example files in both the frontend and backend folders to .env and update the necessary variables like API endpoints, database connection details, and AWS credentials.
Database Setup:

Create the required tables in your MySQL database using the provided SQL schema.
Amazon RDS and S3:

Set up your Amazon RDS instance and configure the MySQL database.
Create an S3 bucket to store images and update your environment variables accordingly.
Deploy to EC2 Instances:

Launch CentOS 7 EC2 instances and deploy the frontend and backend code.
Configure the ELB to distribute traffic across instances.
Testing:

Access your application using the ELB's URL.
Test user registration, login, blog post creation, and image uploading.
Backup and Redundancy:

Set up automated backups and redundancy measures for your application servers.
Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully set up the React Blog Application with Node.js, MySQL, Amazon RDS, and S3 integration. Feel free to explore and customize the application further based on your requirements.

For any issues or further assistance, please refer to the documentation, reach out to the development team, or consult relevant resources for the technologies involved.
